	<h2>Introduction</h2>


	<p>If you are new to screenwriting, planning to write a screenplay or script of any kind, the good news is that writing in screenplay format is easier and more intuitive today than at any time since first Lanier Word Processing Machine. Advances in screenwriting software now save the hours you would previously have spent learning how to write a screenplay in professional Hollywood format can now be allocated to polishing your plot, honing your dialogue, or learning screenplay structure. Some think screenplay writing is eclipsing the pursuit of the Great American Novel but it certainly isn't any easier. At any rate the making of movies is a collaborative process which demands that those in screenwriting produce a document in particular format, notation, and length called a 'script.'</p>

	<p>This overview will begin acquaint you with the screenplay format writing rules and screenwriting etiquette you'll need to know about, and as you browse the following material you may notice the words 'don't', 'avoid' and '...' unless you are directing the movie.' Take that advice to heart. As you become more familiar with the world of screenwriting you'll understand why but for now the scope of this document prohibits a deeper explanation.</p>

	<p>Learning how to write a screenplay involves many facets but I hope this basic information will give you a head start on your endeavors, including practical information to help you get your scripts read. And hopefully turned into movies</p>

	

	<p>A script is a document that outlines every aural, visual, behavioral, and lingual element required to tell a story. Why "outlines"? Because film is a highly collaborative medium and the director, cast, editor, and production crew will, based on your "outline", interpret your story their way when it is filmed. They may consult you, or they may not. Other writers may be brought in or you may be asked to re-write the entire thing. That's life, in the world of screenwriting. But because so many people are involved in the making of a film, a script must conform to standards that all involved parties understand and thus has a specific format or layout, margins, notation, and other conventions. This document is intended to overview the typical elements used screenplay writing</p>
	
		

	<h2>Script Elements</h2>

	<p>These are the unique margin, case, and position attributes that give feature film script text the format and consistency expected by all participants. Once you are accustomed to them you'll be able to tell your story the way an industry reader is accustomed to seeing it. The elements for a script are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Scene Heading</li>
		<li>Action</li>
		<li>Character Name</li>
		<li>Dialogue</li>
		<li>Parenthetical</li>
		<li>Extensions</li>
		<li>Transition</li>
		<li>Shot</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Scene Heading</h3>


	<p>Writing Tip:
	 Scene Heading are aligned flush left (which we learned is about 1.5" from the edge of the paper) and are rarely long enough to reach the page margin.</p>

	<p>The Scene Heading is written in ALL CAPS. Use a period after the INT. or EXT., a hyphen between the other elements of the Slugline.The Scene Heading, sometimes called Slugline, tells the reader of the script where the scene takes place. Are we indoors (INT.) or outdoors (EXT.)? Next name the location: BEDROOM, LIVING ROOM, at the BASEBALL FIELD, inside a CAR? And lastly it might include the time of day - NIGHT, DAY, DUSK, DAWN... information to "set the scene" in the reader's mind</p>

	<h3>Action</h3>
	<p>The narrative description of the events of a scene, written in the present tense. Also less commonly known as direction, visual exposition, blackstuff, description or scene direction</p>

	<h3>ChararcterName</h3>
	<p>Before a character can speak, the writer inserts a CHARACTER NAME to let the reader know this character's dialogue follows.When a character is introduced, his name should be capitalized within the action. A character name can be an actual name (JOHN) or description (FAT MAN) or an occupation (DOCTOR). Sometimes, you might have COP #1 and then COP #2 speaking. It is okay to identify the speaking parts like this, but actors will like you more if you personalize their part with a name. Try to be consistent
